<h3>Development Associate</h3>
<h4>PEARLS for Teen Girls</h4>
<p>As PEARLS for Teen Girls’ part-time Development Associate, I learned a lot about the entrails of development within a vigorous nonprofit environment – and I didn’t earn a “Positive Perspective” award by backing down! I entered this opportunity eagerly, and took on the management of our gift entry, tracking, and acknowledgement processes, along with the coordination of our major annual fundraising event, wrapped up by beating our fundraising goals. Collaboration with an amazing team and opportunities to exercise my creativity through crafting appeals and acknowledgement letters were the most invigorating elements of my experience PEARLS. </p>
