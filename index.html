<h2>Experience</h2>
<h3>Development Associate</h3>
<h4>PEARLS for Teen Girls</h4>
<p>As PEARLS for Teen Girls’ part-time Development Associate, I learned a lot about the entrails of development within a vigorous nonprofit environment – and I didn’t earn a “Positive Perspective” award by backing down! I entered this opportunity eagerly, and took on the management of our gift entry, tracking, and acknowledgement processes, along with the coordination of our major annual fundraising event, wrapped up by beating our fundraising goals. Collaboration with an amazing team and opportunities to exercise my creativity through crafting appeals and acknowledgement letters were the most invigorating elements of my experience PEARLS. </p>
<h3>Civic Engagement Project Leader</h3>
<h4>City Year Milwaukee</h4>
<p>I interpreted my role as City Year Milwaukee’s Civic Engagement Project Leader as not only a privilege, but also a huge responsibility. After service as a first-year AmeriCorps Member, and one in a cohort of 70, to subsequently advance as one of nine Senior Corps Members was an honor. I cherished this opportunity to engage my team of 90 City Year Milwaukee staff and corps members as well as hundreds of community volunteers in large-scale service events, and am immensely proud of the accomplishments I facilitated through dedicated and meticulous logistical planning and organization, and communication to various audiences with distinct needs.</p>
<h3>AmeriCorps Member</h3>
<h4>City Year Milwaukee</h4>
<p>As an AmeriCorps member, I gave my all toward our mission to end the high school dropout crisis, but also grew strides personally and professionally in an atmosphere focused on professional development. With values such as appreciating diversity – not only deomographically, but also of perspectives and personalities – accountability, and service to a cause greater than one’s self, this experience enriched my idea of who I want to be as a professional, and what I value in my team and workplace. Primarily, I provided academic support and mentorship to a class of bilingual eighth graders to keep them on track to ultimately  graduate from high school.</p>
<h3>Marketing and Communications Coordinator</h3>
<h4>Vino 100 Milwaukee</h4>
<p>I enjoyed wearing many hats through organizing the wine bar and boutique’s e-commerce site, establishing consistent messaging visually and verbally through an online presence, email blasts, and event advertising, as well as managing the event calendar and assisting with customer service during events. I especially enjoyed applying my graphic design skills through creating visual communication pieces.</p>
<h3>Editorial Intern</h3>
<h4>Greenspring Media Group</h4>
<p>Raring to put my journalism education and instincts to use, I met this opportunity wide-eyed and supported the custom publishing department through various contributions. I prioritized tasks to manage and complete article assignments pertaining to multiple projects and deadlines, sustained communication with media sources to sustain mutually beneficial, professional relationships, and obtained crucial information and graphics to fulfill media requests.</p>
