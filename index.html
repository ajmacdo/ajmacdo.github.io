<h2>Experience</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Communications & Development Associate | College Possible Milwaukee</h3>
<h5>September 2015-June 2016</h5>
<p>I learned and grew immensely through this grueling role. I supported fundraising and communications efforts to raise the visibility of the issue of the degree divide; I tracked and configured data to monitor and effectively foster donor and advocate relationships; and I gathered interviews and media materials to share public-facing stories about the students College Possible serves. </p>

<h3>Student Advisor | Milwaukee Public Schools TEAM UP College Access Centers</h3>
<h5>June 2014 – September 2015</h5>
<p>I guided 6th through 12th graders’ postsecondary preparation through both individualized advising and group workshops. I utilized communications skills alongside a team-oriented approach to not only contribute and edit communications pieces, but also to foster healthy, productive internal communication practices and atmosphere to effectively accomplish tasks. This was a rewarding opportunity to continue directly working with youth while also exercising my chops in communications.</p>


<h3>Development Associate | PEARLS for Teen Girls</h3>
<h5>September 2014 – April 2015</h5>
<p>As PEARLS for Teen Girls’ part-time Development Associate, I learned a lot about the entrails of development within a vigorous nonprofit environment – and I didn’t earn a “Positive Perspective” award by backing down! I entered this opportunity eagerly, and took on the management of our gift entry, tracking, and acknowledgement processes, along with the coordination of our major annual fundraising event, wrapped up by beating our fundraising goals. Collaboration with an amazing team and opportunities to exercise my creativity through crafting appeals and acknowledgement letters were the most invigorating elements of my experience PEARLS. </p>


<h3>Civic Engagement Project Leader | City Year Milwaukee</h3>
<h5>July 2013 – June 2014</h5>
<p>I interpreted my role as City Year Milwaukee’s Civic Engagement Project Leader as not only a privilege, but also a huge responsibility. After service as a first-year AmeriCorps Member, and one in a cohort of 70, to subsequently advance as one of nine Senior Corps Members was an honor. I cherished this opportunity to engage my team of 90 City Year Milwaukee staff and corps members as well as hundreds of community volunteers in large-scale service events, and am immensely proud of the accomplishments I facilitated through dedicated and meticulous logistical planning and organization, and communication to various audiences with distinct needs.</p>

<h3>AmeriCorps Member | City Year Milwaukee</h3>

<h5>August 2012 – June 2013</h5>
<p>As an AmeriCorps member, I gave my all toward our mission to end the high school dropout crisis, but also grew strides personally and professionally in an atmosphere focused on professional development. With values such as appreciating diversity – not only deomographically, but also of perspectives and personalities – accountability, and service to a cause greater than one’s self, this experience enriched my idea of who I want to be as a professional, and what I value in my team and workplace. Primarily, I provided academic support and mentorship to a class of bilingual eighth graders to keep them on track to ultimately  graduate from high school.</p>

<h3>Marketing and Communications Coordinator | Vino 100 Milwaukee</h3>

<h5>December 2011 – July 2012</h5>
<p>I enjoyed wearing many hats through organizing the wine bar and boutique’s e-commerce site, establishing consistent messaging visually and verbally through an online presence, email blasts, and event advertising, as well as managing the event calendar and assisting with customer service during events. I especially enjoyed applying my graphic design skills through creating visual communication pieces.</p>
<h3>Editorial Intern | Greenspring Media Group</h3>

<h5>January 2011 – May 2011</h5>
<p>Raring to put my journalism education and instincts to use, I met this opportunity wide-eyed and supported the custom publishing department through various contributions. I prioritized tasks to manage and complete article assignments pertaining to multiple projects and deadlines, sustained communication with media sources to sustain mutually beneficial, professional relationships, and obtained crucial information and graphics to fulfill media requests.</p>
<h2>Other Involvement</h2>

  <li><b>Volunteer</b> | Victory Garden Initiative</li>
  <li><b>Volunteer</b> | We Can Ride Therapeutic Horseback Riding</li>

</ul>
<h2>More about me...</h2>
<hr>
<p>Lover of animals, nature, leisurely runs, and warm and cozy beverages. Collector of mugs and scarves, which feeds an internal struggle with my appreciation for minimalism and living sustainably. Meticulous and as eager to put my skills to work as I am to learn. I’m motivated by feeling positioned to see the results of my creative efforts in accomplishments for the whole team, and empowered by the trust and esteem of a team to which I mutually contribute positivity and moral support.</p>
