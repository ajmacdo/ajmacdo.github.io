<h3>Development Associate</h3>
<h4>PEARLS for Teen Girls</h4>
<p>As PEARLS for Teen Girls’ part-time Development Associate, I learned a lot about the entrails of development within a vigorous nonprofit environment – and I didn’t earn a “Positive Perspective” award by backing down! I entered this opportunity eagerly, and took on the management of our gift entry, tracking, and acknowledgement processes, along with the coordination of our major annual fundraising event, wrapped up by beating our fundraising goals. Collaboration with an amazing team and opportunities to exercise my creativity through crafting appeals and acknowledgement letters were the most invigorating elements of my experience PEARLS. </p>
<h3>Civic Engagement Project Leader</h3>
<h4>City Year Milwaukee</h4>
<p>I interpreted my role as City Year Milwaukee’s Civic Engagement Project Leader as not only a privilege, but also a huge responsibility. After service as a first-year AmeriCorps Member, and one in a cohort of 70, to subsequently advance as one of nine Senior Corps Members was an honor. I cherished this opportunity to engage my team of 90 City Year Milwaukee staff and corps members as well as hundreds of community volunteers in large-scale service events, and am immensely proud of the accomplishments I facilitated through dedicated and meticulous logistical planning and organization, and communication to various audiences with distinct needs.</p>
